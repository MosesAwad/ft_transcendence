/*
	NOTES

	Note 1
 		We used a function in .where() to group the where and orWhere conditions â€” which is exactly the right move when we 
		need parentheses around the OR clause in SQL.

		With parenthesis (what we want) -- achieved by using a function to wrap where & orWhere clause:

			SELECT * FROM friendships 
			WHERE (user_id = senderId AND friend_id = receiverId)
			OR (user_id = receiverId AND friend_id = senderId);


		Without parenthesis:

			SELECT * FROM friendships 
			WHERE user_id = senderId 
			AND friend_id = receiverId 
			OR user_id = receiverId 
			AND friend_id = senderId;

			which in this case due to SQL operator precedence resolves to 

			SELECT * FROM friendships 
			WHERE (user_id = senderId AND friend_id = receiverId) 
			OR (user_id = receiverId AND friend_id = senderId);

			which is what we want yeah, BUT in this case it worked out. Though it might not always work out 
			like this, so it's best to be more explicit and to be aware of this capability.

	Note 2

		Notification A:
			"User X (you) has sent you a friend request"
		
		Notification B:
			"User Y has accepted YOUR friend request"

		If status is 'pending', then I, the user using this controller was the sender of the notification (notification type A). 
		However, if status is 'accepted', then I, the user using this controller sent the friend request BUT I am the actually the 
		receiver of the notification, notification type B.

	Note 3

		The query we built with Knex in listFriends resolves to one single query which looks like this in plain SQL:

			SELECT users.id, users.username
			FROM friendships
			JOIN users ON friendships.friend_id = users.id
			WHERE friendships.user_id = ? AND status = 'accepted'

			UNION

			SELECT users.id, users.username
			FROM friendships
			JOIN users ON friendships.user_id = users.id
			WHERE friendships.friend_id = ? AND status = 'accepted';

		The idea is that the current logged-in user could be listed either under the friend_id column (if he received the 
		request) or the user_id column (if he sent the request). That's why we make two joins to reflect both scenarios and 
		join the results in a union.
